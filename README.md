# Testagon

Testagon is a python package that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to reason about logic invariants in your python programs and uses them to generate a suite of comprehensive unit tests. 

Testagon understands your project layout and will accurately find the python files that need to be tested. It will also generate a tests/ folder if it is not present. 

Testagon follows the Actor-Critic method, creating a feedback loop that finds logic vulnerabilities in your source code. 

The “Actor”:
- Detects invariants and writes them into the docstring of your program files
- Generates a test directory and writes unit tests for each one of your program files, allowing the invariants to guide the process

The “Critic”:
- Evaluates your program on the unit tests and records the response
- Sends the response back to the “Actor” to restart the process, aiming to refine the tests and invariants

# Installation

Installing Testagon is easy, just run `pip install testagon`

We support python >= 3.9

# How to Use

- `testagon init` in your project directory
- `testagon generate` to generate unit tests using the actor-critic method
- `testagon test` to evaluate your program on the unit tests
